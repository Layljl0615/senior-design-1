# Major Constraints

- Economic Cost:
    - Our project will not be constrained by economic costs. We will be researching freely available solutions, then developing our own software.
- Time: 
    - While we believe that we will have plenty of time to successfully complete our project, time constraints due to coursework are a definite consideration.
- Scope:
    - Each member of our group discussed and agreed to specific tasks to individually take charge of and work on. We have also thoroughly discussed how we will combine the individual work into our final product.
- Professional/Technical Expertise: 
    - Our project will mainly involve the creation and application of two algorithms (potentially with a component of artificial intelligence) that none of us have prior experience working with. This lack of experience will make the research phase of our project even more important.
- Ethical/ Legal:
    - Our project will not likely have legal implications as conveying factually inaccurate information is generally not against the law. It will have potentially significant ethical implications as the goal is to identify facts and refute infactual information. As such, we will need to careful that our tool works with as much integrity as possible.
- Security:
    - We don't believe security to be a main concern for our project. We will neither collect nor store user information, so there won't be privacy concerns there.
- Social: 
    - Our project is designed to be used for public service. It could benefit society by making it easier and more convenient to evaluate the facts of an online source.
- Environmental: 
    - Our project will have no environmental concerns as it will be entirely software-based.
- Diversity and Cultural Impact: 
    - Our project will likely have the cultural constraint of being usable only on English webpages. In order to identify statements, we will need to apply concepts of natural language processing to an algorithm. To customize this to work with additional languages is outside the scope of our inital design.
